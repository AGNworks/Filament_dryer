# Filament_dryer

Controlling process of drying filaments for 3D printing.

## About

This project is based on Arduino Nano. It uses a relay to turn ON/OFF the heating element and a mosfet to control the fan, which circulates the air inside the dryer.
It is powered by a power supply 12V 150W, and uses a DC-DC step down module to give needed voltage for the Arduino Nano.
